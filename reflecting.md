# 2023 Reflection

There was a certain amount problems that we have to reflect what we have learned from 2023 as lessons for 2024.

Despite being deversed and exuastion, we can still see some bright side

## Problems

It is still becoming a problem of delaying tasks and keeping up on working on upcoming tasks at hand.

Pisatto:

> 1. Procratination caused by somewhat too much work and too things not too serious.
> 2. Things are not adapting to what we have now since tasks nowaday are not comparable to what we have last year including speed and stress handling.
> 3. There are so many new thigns which caused overwhelming and getting so busy getting requirments in order to get things going.
> 4. Underestimating tasks
> 5. Overworked -> Overthinking
> 6. Personal problems -> MUST TO SOLVE WITH CURRENT SITUATIONS

Visal:

> 1. Losing interest -> New technologies
> 2. So many things to learn to keep up with works and tasks
> 3. Which caused losing movitaion, stress. **_Thinking about how to start?_** (PP?)
> 4. Procrastinated

> 1. Procratination -> Craving for entertaining, and dopamine.
> 2. Having less visual plan of what should be learning and what shouldn't
> 3. Didn't stop or eleminate distractions -> Gaming (Chess, valorant, mobile legends) -> Emotional issues

### What should do

- One task at a time and focus on what we have
- Never underestimate tasks
- Cope with ADHD
- Never become a generalist, but specialist
- Choosing consistency ~ Continous work & improvement ~ **NO ONE TIME PERFECT**
- Task not delivering on time is a total failure -> delivering task on time is a far better
  **Value Time**
- Know your place and take time learning -> everything take time to become perfect
- **Less guidance** -> Need to get interactivity
- Be more flexible and constantly visualized every task daily **(Bucker list)**
